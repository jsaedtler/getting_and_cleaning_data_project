# Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

## Intro

The attached run_analysis.R script generates the output for the course project.

It's structured into different functions for each step and writes the required
output at the end.

## Running the script

The script requires the extracted UCI HAR Dataset as folder in it's working
directory. Just run the script and it will produce a tiny.csv output file.

In case you don't have the extracted data, set download_file to T, and the 
script will download and extract the required zip file.
